# mskott.github.io - personal blog

Beginnings of a personal blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and GitHub pages.
The site uses the [Congo theme](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/).

Editing is mostly done using VSCode with the plugins *Markdown All in One*, and *Code Spell Checker*.

Deployment is done using GitHub actions as documented in the [Congo deployment documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/hosting-deployment/#github-pages).
