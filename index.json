At least I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to sell anything to anyone here ðŸ˜€\nI would also like to work on my writing - not only to improve my communication, but also to improve my English.

Maybe even find a morsel or two of useful information.\nInspiration # Two people who have inspired me to begin blogging are Julia Evans and Major Hayden.
