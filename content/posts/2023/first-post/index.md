It's 2023 and I have started a blog!

I have previously made several half-hearted attempts, but none that really took of (as in me actually posting something).

# Why now?

Writing has always been something I enjoyed doing, but since I left school most of my writing has been work related.
Some of my writing here is probably going to resemble work quite a lot, but lets see where it goes.
At least I'm not trying to sell anything to anyone here ðŸ˜€

I would also like to work on my writing - not only to improve my communication, but also to improve my English.
Although I have lived in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and speak English on a daily basis I still feel there is room for improvement.


# Who is the reader?

Myself mostly, but I wouldn't mind if others would read my posts. 
Maybe even find a morsel or two of useful information.

# Inspiration

Two people who have inspired me to begin blogging are [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/06/05/some-blogging-myths/) and [Major Hayden](https://major.io/p/how-i-write-blog-posts/).
Both make some really good points, and Major really puts it into plain language:

> Write for you â€“ not for anyone else.

There you have it, lets see how long it lasts ðŸ˜€
